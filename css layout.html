<h1>The US TV series </h1>
<p>And as we raise the digestif to our lips, we might pause, before sipping, and ponder the feast that was Hannibal, the series finale of which airs on US TV on Saturday, 29 August. (Canada and other territories have already had a taste of the closing installment.) Despite being adapted from a well-established franchise of novels and running for three seasons, the show never found much of an audience. Yet those who did watch frequently praised Hannibal as one of the most inventive and distinctive series ever made. Its impact on critics and many others who care passionately about TV says much about our current television landscape, though: you don’t necessarily need to be a hit to make a mark.</p>
<h1>The cannibalistic</h1>
<p>He did the same with readers, and the character asserted himself beyond the page as well, becoming a fixture of the pop culture landscape after two terrific film adaptations. In Michael Mann’s Manhunter (1986), he was played with soft-spoken malevolence by Brian Cox, while in Jonathan Demme’s The Silence of the Lambs (1991), Anthony Hopkins enshrined Lecter as a lip-smacking bogeyman par excellence and took home an Oscar for his efforts. After that, well… the discussion still rages over Harris’s Hannibal (1999), which brought the doctor front and centre, and inspired a movie version by Ridley Scott (with Hopkins reprising his role) that went for a bloodily baroque mood it never quite sold. And the less said about Brett Ratner’s 2002 Red Dragon, which entirely wasted its starry cast, or the cynical cash-grabs that were the prequel novel and film Hannibal Rising, the better.</p>

<h1>Pharaoh </h1>
<p>During the early days prior to the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt, the Deshret or the "Red Crown", was a representation of the kingdom of Lower Egypt, while the Hedjet, the "White Crown", was worn by the kings of the kingdom of Upper Egypt. After the unification of both kingdoms into one united Egypt, the Pschent, the combination of both the red and white crowns was the official crown of kings. With time new headdresses were introduced during different dynasties such as the Khat, Nemes, Atef, Hemhem crown, and Khepresh. At times, it was depicted that a combination of these headdresses or crowns would be worn together.</p>
<h1>Nemes </h1>
<p>The Nemes headdress dates from the time of Djoser. It is the most common type of crown that has been depicted throughout Pharaonic Egypt. Any other type of crown, apart from the Khat headdress, has been commonly depicted on top of the Nemes. The statue from his Serdab in Saqqara shows the king wearing the nemes headdress.</p>
<h1>Physical evidence </h1>
<p>Egyptologist Bob Brier has noted that despite their widespread depiction in royal portraits, no ancient Egyptian crown has ever been discovered. Tutankhamun's tomb, discovered largely intact, did contain such regalia as his crook and flail, but no crown was found among the funerary equipment. Diadems have been discovered.[24] It is presumed that crowns would have been believed to have magical properties. Brier's speculation is that crowns were religious or state items, so a dead pharaoh likely could not retain a crown as a personal possession. The crowns may have been passed along to the successor</p>
